# StreamLabs Chatbot Script - New Currency

Script for Streamlabs Chatbot for adding a new currency

# Installation and use

On Streamlabs Chatbot interface, go to `Scripts` and on the top right icons,
click on the `Import` button and chose the zip file containing this
repository. This will install the script itself.

# Database

The script uses SQLite python library to create a local database file containing
all the users and their currencies. The database file location is the same as the
script itself. For example:

* C:\Users\`<USER>`\AppData\Roaming\Streamlabs\Streamlabs Chatbot\Services\Scripts\sl-chatbot-newcurrency

Where `<USER>` is your local user. All databases used by this script will have
the `.db` extension.
